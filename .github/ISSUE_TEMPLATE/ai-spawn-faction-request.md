**Mod Name**
Name of Mod from Steam Workshop

**Mod Link**
Link to Mod from the Steam Workshop. Mods from external sources will not be accepted at this time.

**Faction Names**
Names of specific factions you want added to the module. Be aware that some mods have over 50 factions and we won't be able to add them all. Please only request those that are needed.

**Requested Deadline**
If you have a genuine reason for a faction to be added e.g. "I need this for a mission next Friday" then we'll be sure to get you an answer before that date. If accepted, we'll work on getting it done before this deadline but please be aware that adding custom factions is our lowest priority right now.

**Additional Info**
Add any additional info as required.
